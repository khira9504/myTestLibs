  # Fix RLS Policies to Prevent Infinite Recursion

  1. Problem
    - Current policies are causing infinite recursion
    - Policies reference the same tables they're protecting
    - This prevents users from viewing their own projects

  2. Solution
    - Simplify policies to use direct ownership checks
    - Remove complex subqueries that cause recursion
    - Create clear, non-recursive access patterns

  3. Security
    - Maintain proper access control
    - Ensure users can only access their own data
    - Keep team collaboration working for Pro users
