/*
  # Final Fix for Infinite Recursion in Project Policies

  1. Problem
    - Infinite recursion still occurring when creating projects
    - Complex policies with subqueries causing circular dependencies
    - Team collaboration policies interfering with basic project creation

  2. Solution
    - Use the simplest possible policies for core functionality
    - Separate team collaboration from basic project operations
    - Use direct table references without complex subqueries
    - Ensure project creation works first, then add team features

  3. Approach
    - Start with owner-only policies (no recursion possible)
    - Add team collaboration through separate, simple policies
    - Use materialized views for complex access patterns
