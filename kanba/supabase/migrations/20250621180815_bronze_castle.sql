  # Fix Infinite Recursion with Simple Non-Recursive Policies

  1. Problem
    - Policies are creating infinite recursion by referencing the same tables
    - Even helper functions can't solve this when policies reference project_members within project policies

  2. Solution
    - Use completely separate, simple policies that don't cross-reference
    - Temporarily disable team collaboration to get basic functionality working
    - Focus on owner-only access first, then add team features separately

  3. Approach
    - Drop ALL existing policies
    - Create simple owner-only policies
    - Add team collaboration in a separate, controlled way
